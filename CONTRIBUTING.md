### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: This tags related to problems that require people that have experience with behaviorbot before and willing to spend some of their time to help us develop new way for it to help uses across the site.
- **qa-needed**: This tags refer to people willing to spend their time and help us testing out the new build or new feature that may or may not being publicly ready yet. We owe you a prayer kind tester :prayer:
- **documentation-needed**: Do you like writing legal terms? Do you like writing contracts and all the boring stuffs that is utmost necessary to run our world? Well then this job is for you :sunglasses: We looking for people that can write us a documentation for the development and the team behind as well as other terms and services. :hammer:
- **bug-high-priority**: Did you just find a major bug? One that could potentially break the very fabric of space-time conundrum :surprise:. This is for bugs that are so dangerous to the program and could break the whole structure down. Bugs that require urgent care and clear insight to fix.
- **bug-low-priority**: Visual bugs, bugs that only appear if you follow a rigorous procedure and still not be able to re-create sometime. Bugs that may contribute to system slow down or just mildly irritating when look at :angry:.
- **help-wanted**: Section that allow all users to ask any question regarding to how the bot works or anything else that is not already mentioned in documentation. :question: Put them in here and our team will answer them as soon as possible :smile:
